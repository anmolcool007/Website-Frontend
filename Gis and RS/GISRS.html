Now-a-days the field of Remote Sensing and GIS has become exciting and glamorous with rapidly expanding opportunities. Many organizations spend large amounts of money on these fields. Here the question arises why these fields are so important in recent years. Two main reasons are there behind this.<br>
1) Now-a-days scientists, researchers, students, and even common people are showing great interest for better understanding of our environment. By environment we mean the geographic space of their study area and the events that take place there. In other words, we have come to realise that geographic space along with the data describing it, is part of our everyday world; almost every decision we take is influenced or dictated by some fact of geography.<br>
2) Advancement in sophisticated space technology (which can provide large volume of spatial data), along with declining costs of computer hardware and software (which can handle these data) has made Remote Sensing and G.I.S. affordable to not only complex environmental / spatial situation but also affordable to an increasingly wider audience.<br>

Therefore, it becomes the need of the hour to be aware of GIS and RS so as to help the earth and society for sustainable future.

If we go by this meaning of Remote Sensing, then a number of things would be coming under Remote Sensor, e.g. Seismographs, fathometer etc. Without coming in direct contact with the focus of earthquake, seismograph can measure the intensity of earthquake. Likewise without coming in contact with the ocean floor, fathometer can measure its depth. However, modern Remote Sensing means acquiring information about earth&acute;s land and water surfaces by using reflected or emitted electromagnetic energy.<hr></td>  <td width="350"> <img src="images/rs/1.jpg"class="effectscale"> </td>  </tr>            </table>   </div>  </div>

Remote sensing applications include monitoring deforestation in areas such as theAmazon Basin, glacial features in Arctic and Antarctic regions, and depth sounding of coastal and ocean depths. Military collection during the Cold War made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas. Remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground, ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.<br>

Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as El Nino and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the earth sciences such as natural resource management, agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation, and national security and overhead, ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas.

                <td width="800"><hr><font size="+1.5">The modern discipline of remote sensing arose with the development of flight. The balloonist G. Tournachon (alias Nadar) made photographs of Paris from his balloon in 1858. Messenger pigeons, kites, rockets and unmanned balloons were also used for early images. With the exception of balloons, these first, individual images were not particularly useful for map making or for scientific purposes.<br>

Systematic aerial photography was developed for military surveillance and reconnaissance purposes beginning in World War I and reaching a climax during the Cold War with the use of modified combat aircraft such as the P-51, P-38, RB-66 and the F-4C, or specifically designed collection platforms such as the U2/TR-1, SR-71, A-5 and the OV-1 series both in overhead and stand-off collection. A more recent development is that of increasingly smaller sensor pods such as those used by law enforcement and the military, in both manned and unmanned platforms. The advantage of this approach is that this requires minimal modification to a given airframe. Later imaging technologies would include Infra-red, conventional, Doppler and synthetic aperture radar.<br>

The development of artificial satellites in the latter half of the 20th century allowed remote sensing to progress to a global scale as of the end of the Cold War. Instrumentation aboard various Earth observing and weather satellites such as Landsat, the Nimbus and more recent missions such as RADARSAT and UARS provided global measurements of various data for civil, research, and military purposes. Space probes to other planets have also provided the opportunity to conduct remote sensing studies in extraterrestrial environments, synthetic aperture radar aboard the Magellan spacecraft provided detailed topographic maps of Venus, while instruments aboard SOHOallowed studies to be performed on the Sun and the solar wind, just to name a few examples.<br>

Recent developments include, beginning in the 1960s and 1970s with the development of image processing of satellite imagery. Several research groups in Silicon Valley including NASA Ames Research Center, GTE, and ESL Inc. developed Fourier transform techniques leading to the first notable enhancement of imagery data.[citation needed] In 1999 the first commercial satellite (IKONOS) collecting very high resolution imagery was launched.<br>

              <br><ul type="disc"> <font size="+1.5">
<li>	1. Conventional radar is mostly associated with aerial traffic control, early warning, and certain large scale meteorological data. Doppler radar is used by local law enforcements’ monitoring of speed limits and in enhanced meteorological collection such as wind speed and direction within weather systems in addition to precipitation location and intensity.</li>
<br>
<li>  2. Laser and radar altimeters on satellites have provided a wide range of data. By measuring the bulges of water caused by gravity, they map features on the seafloor to a resolution of a mile or so. By measuring the height and wavelength of ocean waves, the altimeters measure wind speeds and direction, and surface ocean currents and directions.</li>
<br>
<li> 3. Ultrasound (acoustic) and radar tide gauges measure sea level, tides and wave direction in coastal and offshore tide gauges.</li>
<br>
<li> 	5. Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) is well known in examples of weapon ranging, laser illuminated homing of projectiles. LIDAR is used to detect and measure the concentration of various chemicals in the atmosphere!</li>
<br>
<li> 	6. Radiometers and photometers are the most common instrument in use, collecting reflected and emitted radiation in a wide range of frequencies. The most common are visible and infrared sensors, followed by microwave, gamma ray and rarely, ultraviolet.</li>
<br>
<li> 	7. Stereographic pairs of aerial photographs have often been used to make topographic maps by imagery and terrain analysts in trafficability and highway departments for potential routes, in addition to modelling terrestrial habitat features.</li>
<br>
<li> 	 8. Landsat images are used by regulatory agencies such as KYDOW to indicate water quality parameters including Secchi depth, chlorophyll a density and total phosphorus content. Weather satellites are used in meteorology and climatology.</li>
<br>
<li> 9.	Hyperspectral imaging produces an image where each pixel has full spectral information with imaging narrow spectral bands over a contiguous spectral range. Hyperspectral imagers are used in various applications including mineralogy, biology, defence, and environmental measurements   </li></ul>

                <td width="800"><hr><font size="+1.5">The expansion of GIS is Geographic Information System which consists of three words, viz. Geographic, Information and System. Here the word <strong>Geographic</strong> deals with spatial objects or features which can be referenced or related to a specific location on the earth surface. The object may be physical / natural or may be cultural / man made. Likewise the word<strong> Information</strong> deals with the large volume of data about a particular object on the earth surface. The data includes a set of qualitative and quantitative aspects which the real world objects acquire. The term <strong>System</strong> is used to represent systems approach where the complex environment (consists of a large number, of objects / features on the earth surface and their complex characteristics) is broken down into their component parts for easy understanding and handling, but is considered to form an integrated whole for managing and decision making. Now-a-days this is possible in a very short span of time with the development of sophisticated computer hardware and software. Therefore, GIS is a computer based information system which attaches a variety of qualities and characteristics to geographical location and helps in planning and decision making.<hr></td>

<strong>Indian Society of Geomatics (ISG)</strong> &amp; <strong>Indian Space Application Centre (ISRO) </strong>defined GIS as a system which provides a computerised mechanism for integrating various geoinformation data sets and analysing them in order to generate information relevant to planning needs in a context.<br>


According to Centre for Spatial Database Management and Solutions (CSDMS), GIS is a computer based tool for mapping and analysing things that exist and events that happen one earth.<br>

<strong>Burrough (1986) </strong>defined GIS as a set of tools for collecting, storing, retrieving at will, transforming and displaying spatial data from the real world for a particular set of purpose.<br>


<strong>Arnoff (1989)</strong> defined GIS as a computer based system that provides four sets of capabilities to handle geo referenced data, viz. data input, data management (data storage and retrieval), manipulation analysis and data output.
<br>

From the above definitions, we can conclude that a GIS user expects support from the system to enter geo referenced data to analyse it in various ways and to produce output (maps and other) from the data. GIS draws on concepts and ideas from many different disciplines, such as cartography, congitive science, computer science, engineering, environmental sciences, geodesy, landscape architecture, law, photogrammetry, public policy, remote sensing, statistics and surveying. So, it involves not only the study of the fundamental issues arising from the creation, handling, storage and use of geographic information, but it also examines the impacts of GIS on individuals and society and the influences of society on GIS.

                <td width="800"><hr><font size="+1.5"> <strong>1) </strong>Keeping long tradition of map making as background, G.I.S. has been developed during mid 20th century with the development of computer science. The data analysis of geographic locations was being done by computers in government organizations and universities in U.S.A. during 1950s and 1960s. <br>
The first true operational G.I.S. was developed by Dr. Roger Tomlinson, Department of Forestry and Rural Development , Canada. It was called as Canada Geographic Information System (CGIS) and was used to store analyse and manipulate land related data. Dr. Roger Tomlison was also known as the <strong>Father of G.I.S</strong>. In 1964, a laboratory of Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis was established at the Harvard Graduate School of Design by Howard T. Fisher. This organization developed a number of important theoretical concepts of spatial data handling and in 1970s it distributed seminal software code and system such as <strong>SYMAP</strong>, <strong>GRID</strong> and <strong>ODYSSEY</strong>. This inspired subsequent commercial development.<br>
<strong>2)</strong> By early 1980s, M & S Computing( later Intergraph) and Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) emerged as commercial vendors of G.I.S. software. ESRI released ARC/ Info and ARC View software in 1981 and 1992 respectively. <br>
By the end of 20th Century, the development of ARC View enabled viewing G.I.S. data through internet and eliminated many of the hardware and licensing expenses of software packages. Since then a number of organisations and universities have been doing research in the field of G.I.S. and developing user friendly softwares . Now there is a growing number of free, open source G.I.S. packages which run in a wide range of operating systems and perform specific tasks. <hr></td>  <td width="350"> <img src="images/gis/3.jpg" class="effectscale">   </td>  </tr>

<pre> <font size="+1.5"><strong>Data Entry</strong> </pre>
Both spatial and attribute data are entered into computer system by different input devices like scanner, digitizer, key board, mouse etc. Scanner, digitizer, mouse are used for entering spatial data. The attribute data available as reports, tables etc. are entered through key board. As the data is drawn from different sources, they have different scales, projections, referencing system etc. Therefore, there is a need to standardise the database to common standard. GIS software enables this operation by <strong>geo referencing</strong> or <strong>rubber sheeting</strong> method. This means stretching of maps in different directions so as to match with known coordinates.
<pre> <font size="+1.5"><strong>Storage of Data</strong> </pre>
The different spatial entities which represent different features of real world can be stored in two different formats in the computer: in raster format and in vector format. The knowledge of these formats in which spatial data are stored, is required for decision makers as it affects the accuracy of data, their analysis, storing capacity of computer etc.<br>

In raster format, the entire study area is divided into regular grid or square cells organized into rows and columns. Individual cells are used for storing point, line and area entities. The point data are stored in individual cells. The line data are stored by linking cells into lines. The area units are stored by grouping cells into polygons. The size of the grid cell is very important as it influences the accuracy of spatial features.
