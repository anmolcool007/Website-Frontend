                        <p>Satellite data provides quick and useful baseline information
on the parameters controlling the occurrence and
movement of groundwater, e.g. geology, geomorphology,
soils, landuse, lineaments etc.</p>
						<p>In this study, basic maps such as lineaments and geologic
maps in a digital form were produced to analyze
and to interpret the satellite data. The satellite data registration,
correction (geometric and atmospheric) and
other image processing (such as enhancement, filtering,
classifications, resolution merge), together with field
checking of the relevant area were applied. All the
available spatial data were assembled in a digital form,
and properly registered to make sure the spatial component
overlapped correctly. This produced mapped layers,
including annual rainfall, geology, lineament density,
topographic elevation, slope, drainage density and landuse.
Various analyses, such as table analysis and weight
calculation, were made for extracting this data. Suitable
weights were assigned for different parameters to assess
  groundwater potential.</p><p>Satellites follow three different types of orbits around Earth: geostationary, geosynchronous, and polar. Communications satellites maintain the same position above a fixed point on the Equator some 35,900 km (22,300 miles) from Earth. This is called a geostationary orbit and is similar to a geosynchronous orbit, in which satellites loop once or twice around a certain point on the Equator each day. Remote sensing satellites follow polar orbits. These are much closer to Earth and pass over the north and south poles once each day.</p><table> <tr> <td><span class="neon"><font size="+4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages</font></span></td>

            			<p>A groundwater model using a geographic information system (GIS) has many distinct advantages over traditional models. The most important benefit of using GIS is that everything is defined within a spatial context. The distribution of precipitation, groundwater recharge and pumping, and reservoirs can all be seen on a single map. Moreover, relationships between these components are easily determined because GIS is essentially a database that can combine this information in an infinite number of ways. Traditional models are usually confined to a specific process, location, or set of conditions. In GIS, however, a single model can perform analyses for a variety of situations by simply having a map of a region and knowledge concerning its physical parameters. This report is intended as a brief overview of how this important tool can be used for groundwater modeling.</p>
						<p>The major advantage of a map-based groundwater model is the capacity to display various types of information within a spatial framework. Being able to visualize the magnitude and direction of flow within an aquifer, for example, strengthens the analysis of the underlying physical processes that are occurring. Relationships between the representation and associated data are easily established through the use of geographic information systems (GIS) and object-oriented programming (OOP). Consequently, generic simulation programs can be applied to any region given the digital elevation model (DEM) and knowledge regarding the system parameters.

Using OOP, a map is divided into a series of line and polygon objects. A groundwater cell, for example, is represented by a polygon object. An object can be described by its state and behavior. The state of an object is described by various types of data that are stored and managed within a GIS database. Tables for groundwater cell objects specify hydraulic conductivity and whether the aquifer is confined or phreatic, amongst other things. An objects behavior is simulated through scripts, which are programs that work within the GIS environment.</p>
						<p> Modeling in GIS has a major advantage over traditional methods because of it's ability to describe relationships between the different components of a hydrologic system within a spatial context. In the report, the simulation of groundwater movement through scripts was described. The program retrieves the parameters necessary to solve equations in the scripts using references to specific map features. The manner in which interactions between surface and groundwater flows are accounted for was also explained. Finally, the groundwater exercise and the regional model that were developed over the course of this study were summarized. GIS is an important resource for any hydrologic study and will definitely have an increasingly prominent role in the future.					</p>

                		<p>Although many high yield bedrock formations exist in upstate New York, "the most productive aquifers ... consist of unconsolidated deposits of sand and gravel that occupy major river and stream valleys or lake plains and terraces. Ground water in these aquifers occurs under water-table (unconfined) or artesian (confined) conditions. Municipalities, industries, and farms have been built over many of these aquifers because they typically form flat areas that are suitable for development and generally provide an ample ground-water supply. This development, coupled with the high permeability of these deposits and shallow depth to the water table, makes these aquifers particularly susceptible to contamination from point sources such as landfills and petroleum storage and nonpoint sources such as urban and agricultural runoff" (quote from USGS, New York).</p>
					  <p>To enhance and promote proper development, management, and protection of the unconsolidated aquifers of upstate New York, the Department of Environmental Conservation has long partnered with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to conduct research and publish reports of groundwater resources of the state. USGS also partners with various local agencies. The distribution and hydrogeologic characteristics of the unconsolidated aquifers are presented at the 1:250,000 scale in a series of five maps published in 1988 on a cooperative basis between the USGS and DEC. These reports are available on the USGS webpage titled "Unconsolidated Aquifers in Upstate New York, 1:250,000 Scale" </p>
						<p>A GIS data set containing the mapping of 1:24,000 scale Primary and Principal Aquifers (outside link leaving DEC's website) is available at the NYS GIS Clearinghouse. Enhancements were made to these maps to create digital, georeferenced map layers. The digital map layers contain original mapping units and aquifer boundaries as well as new standardized mapping units and updated aquifer boundaries. The original published aquifer maps contain additional base and geologic information not included in these map layers.

Additionally a GIS coverage for 1:250,000 scale Principal Aquifers (outside link leaving DEC's website) is also available at the NYS GIS Clearinghouse.

                		<p>GIS can be a powerful tool for developing solutions for water resources problems for assessing water quality, determining water availability, preventing flooding, understanding the natural environment, and managing water resources on a local or regional scale. Though there are a number of spatial modeling techniques available with respect to application in GIS, spatial interpolation technique through Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) approach has been used in the present study to delineate the locational distribution of water pollutants or constituents. This method uses a defined or selected set of sample points for estimating the output grid cell value. It determines the cell values using a linearly weighted combination of a set of sample points and controls the significance of known points upon the interpolated values based upon their distance from the output point thereby generating a surface grid as well as thematic isolines. Important water quality indicating parameters and their distribution patterns were studied in Hyderabad metropolis also with the help of cartographic techniques. Thus, GIS enables us to look into the cause and effect relationship with visual presentation .</p>
						<p>Water Quality index is calculated to determine the suitability of water for drinking purpose. Water quality index values revealed that the ground water at many locations of the study area was of good quality with the WQI ranging in between 0–50 and therefore can be used for human consumption.</p>
						<p>The analysis of the results drawn at various stages of the work revealed that integration of Remote Sensing and GIS are effective tools for the preparation of various digital thematic layers and maps showing spatial distribution of various water quality parameters. Overlaying spatial distribution water quality maps on Satellite imagery is a very authenticate concept to identify the water quality problems and to correlate them with the land use to interpret the reasons for deterioration of environmental quality.

Monitoring of pollution patterns and its trends with respect to urbanization is an important task for achieving sustainable management of groundwater. An integrated Remote sensing and GIS study proves to be an essential tool to evaluate and quantify the impacts of land use / land cover on ground water quality. Spatial distribution maps of various pollution parameters are used to demarcate the locational distribution of water pollutants in a comprehensive manner and help in suggesting groundwater pollution control and remedial measures in a holistic way.</p><table> <tr> <td><span class="neon"><font size="+4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Languages</font></span></td>

                		<p>The role of ground water to meet the demand of water in agricultural, industrial and domestic sector is progressively increasing. Although, India has substantial ground water resource availability, its scientific management is necessary, both in the short term and long term perspective. The wide diversity of geological structure in the country calls for a combination of techniques to identify potential ground water resources, assess their potential, draw/abstract the water prudently and manage both, its quantity and quality in the long term. The technology in the field of ground water has rapidly progressed in the past decade and application f new techniques could benefit Indian in managing this vital resource effectively and efficiently</p>
						<p>The study provides a baseline against which any future impacts on groundwater from mining operations, groundwater abstraction or climate change can be assessed.

All underground engineering projects have the potential to have an impact on groundwater.
So it is essential we understand how the water falling on the surface finds its way to the aquifers deep underground.</p>
						<p>Some technology such as Groundwater remediation can be used which is stated as follows:<br>
                        Ground water remediation techniques span biological, chemical, and physical treatment technologies. Most ground water treatment techniques utilize a combination of technologies. Some of the biological treatment techniques include bioaugmentation, bioventing, biosparging, bioslurping, and phytoremediation. Some chemical treatment techniques include ozone and oxygen gas injection, chemical precipitation, membrane separation, ion exchange, carbon absorption, aqueous chemical oxidation, and surfactant enhanced recovery. Some chemical techniques may be implemented using nanomaterials. Physical treatment techniques include, but are not limited to, pump and treat, air sparging, and dual phase extraction.
