<h2 align="left"> <pre>  What Is Groundwater?  </pre> </h2>

<br>

<p align="justify">Groundwater, water found below the surface of the land. Such water exists in pores between sedimentary particles and in the fissures of more solid rocks. In arctic regions, groundwater may be frozen. In general such water maintains a fairly even temperature very close to the mean annual temperature of the area. Very deep-lying groundwater can remain undisturbed for thousands or millions of years. Most groundwater lies at shallower depths, however, and plays a slow but steady part in the hydrologic cycle. Worldwide, groundwater accounts for about one-third of one percent of the earth's water, or about 20 times more than the total of surface waters on continents and islands.</p>
<p align="justify">Groundwater is of major importance to civilization, because it is the largest reserve of drinkable water in regions where humans can live. Groundwater may appear at the surface in the form of springs, or it may be tapped by wells. During dry periods it can also sustain the flow of surface water, and even where the latter is readily available, groundwater is often preferable because it tends to be less contaminated by wastes and organisms.</p>

 <b><font size="+2.5"> Something without which you can't imagine the world !! </font></b><br><hr> 
<p align="justify">Groundwater plays a vital role in the development of arid and semiarid zones, sometimes supporting vast agricultural and industrial enterprises that could not otherwise exist. It is particularly fortunate that aquifers antedating the formation of deserts remain unaffected by increases in aridity with the passage of time. Withdrawal, however, will deplete even the largest of groundwater basins so that development based on the existence of aquifers can be only temporary at best.</p>
<p align="justify">A vast amount of groundwater is distributed throughout the world, and a large number of groundwater reservoirs are still underdeveloped or uninvestigated. The most frequently investigated or exploited groundwater reservoirs are of the unconsolidated clastic (mainly sand and gravel) or carbonate hardrock type found in alluvial valleys and coastal plains under temperate or arid conditions.</p>
<p align="justify">Though some groundwater dissolves substances from rocks and may contain traces of old seawater, most groundwater is free of pathogenic organisms, and purification for domestic or industrial use is not necessary. Furthermore, groundwater supplies are not seriously affected by short droughts and are available in many areas that do not have dependable surface water supplies.</p><hr>
</p><table><tr><td><center><font size="5">Water Table</font></center><br>

<p> <font size="+1">
Upper level of an underground surface in which the soil or rocks are permanently saturated with water. The water table separates the groundwater zone that lies below it from the capillary fringe, or zone of aeration, that lies above it. The water table fluctuates both with the seasons and from year to year because it is affected by climatic variations and by the amount of precipitation used by vegetation. It also is affected by withdrawing excessive amounts of water from wells or by recharging them artificially.<br>
<strong>Hence, we need to realise the importance of groundwater and understand its "sustainable" use, so as we do not face great water scarcity in future</strong>.</font>

<h2 align="left"><pre> Scarcity of Groundwater</pre> </h2>
<p align="justify">In hydrology, rock layer that contains water and releases it in appreciable amounts. The rock contains water-filled pore spaces, and, when the spaces are connected, the water is able to flow through the matrix of the rock. An aquifer also may be called a water-bearing stratum, lens, or zone.</p>
<p align="justify">A confined aquifer is a water-bearing stratum that is confined or overlain by a rock layer that does not transmit water in any appreciable amount or that is impermeable. There probably are few truly confined aquifers, because tests have shown that the confining strata, or layers, although they do not readily transmit water, over a period of time contribute large quantities of water by slow leakage to supplement production from the principal aquifer.</p>
<p align="justify">A groundwater aquifer is said to be unconfined when its upper surface (water table) is open to the atmosphere through permeable material. As opposed to a confined aquifer, the water table in an unconfined aquifer system has no overlying impervious rock layer to separate it from the atmosphere. </p>
