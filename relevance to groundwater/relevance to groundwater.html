<p>Remote sensing with its advantages of spatial, spectral and temporal availability of data covering
large and inaccessible areas within short time has become a very handy tool in assessing, monitoring
and conserving groundwater resources. Satellite data provides quick and useful baseline information
on the parameters controlling the occurrence and movement of groundwater like lithology/structural,
geomorphology, soils, landuse/landcover, lineaments etc.</p> <p> It has also been found that remote sensing besides helping
in targeting potential zones for groundwater exploration provides inputs towards estimation of the
total groundwater resources in an area, the selection of appropriate sites for artificial recharge and
the depth of the weathering area. By combining the remote sensing information with adequate field
data, particularly well inventory and yield data, it is possible to arrive at prognostic models to predict
the ranges of depth, the yield, the success rate and the types of wells suited to various terrain under
different hydro-geological domains.</p><p> Based on the status of groundwater development and
groundwater irrigated areas (though remote sensing), artificial recharge structures such as
percolation tanks, check dams and subsurface dykes can be recommended upstream of groundwater
irrigated areas to recharge the wells in the downstream areas so as to augment groundwater resources.</p>

<p>Geographic information systems (GISs) have become a useful and important tool in hydrology and to hydrologists in the scientific study and management of water resources. Climate change and greater demands on water resources require a more knowledgeable disposition of arguably one of our most vital resources.</p><p>It can be argued that the depiction of groundwater is an even more complex task than that of surface water. The two resources are by no means disjoint, as knowing where surface water recharges groundwater and where groundwater flows supply surface water is an important aspect of the hydrologic cycle. Hydrogeology is especially well suited to GIS. Groundwater moves much more slowly than surface water, on the order of less than a meter per day up to perhaps a hundred meters per day, and is 3-dimensional in flow. In contrast, surface water flows much faster and is more two-dimensional. Groundwater flow is a function of geology and “head,” the total potential energy at a location. Groundwater flows from higher head to lower head at a travel rate and flow path dictated by geology. Head values, geology, groundwater flow direction, even water table height and location of aquifers are among the quantities which may be presented spatially in GIS and used for analysis, management of water availability and water quality, and land use practices.</p>

                <p align="left">As groundwater becomes increasingly important for living and environment, techniques are asked for an improved exploration. The demand is not only to detect new groundwater resources but also to protect them.</p><p>Geophysical techniques are the key to find groundwater. Combination of geophysical measurements with boreholes and borehole measurements help to describe groundwater systems and their dynamics. There are a number of geophysical techniques based on the principles of geoelectrics, electromagnetics, seismics, gravity and magnetics, which are used in exploration of geological structures in particular for the purpose of discovering georesources. The special geological setting of groundwater systems, i.e. structure and material, makes it necessary to adopt and modify existing geophysical techniques. A new discipline called hydrogeophysics has been formed and is growing fast. Efforts for direct detection of groundwater led recently to a new technique: Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SNMR). The principle of nuclear magnetic resonance, well known in physics, physical chemistry as well as in medicine, has successfully been adapted to assess the existence of groundwater and the aquifer parameters. This technique allows for the first time detecting and assessing water directly by only surface measurements allowing quantitative information about mobile water content as well as pore structure parameters leading to hydraulic conductivities. Function, results, interpretation, advantages and drawbacks of SNMR are reviewed in this paper showing the current state of art and developments. A comprehensive example of SNMR is presented with measurements conducted at the site of Nauen near Berlin. The site has Quaternary aquifers with differing layering of sand and till. The results are very satisfying as aquifers down to 50 m depth can be identified quite reliably. The water content is estimated with a high degree of accuracy and relaxation times allowed to derive hydraulic conductivities. Supplementary measurements with geoelectrics and radar made possible to complement and confirm the information achieved with SNMR as well as to apply a joint multimethod approach to aquifer assessment.</p> <br>
